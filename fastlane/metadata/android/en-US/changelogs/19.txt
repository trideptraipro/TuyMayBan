2.4.1 is here!

Support-related:
- Dropped support for Android versions under 14 (by AdamHooyer)
- Improved Italian translation (by ilpianista)
- Added Turkish translation (by berkaygunduzz)
- Now compiles on and targets API 28 (by TacoTheDank)

Design-related: (by TacoTheDank)
- Code optimizations
- Adaptive app icon
- Muted actionbar color to a paler green so it's not so bright
- Actionbar will no longer change color for now because white will make icons invisible
- Improved actionbar icons; they now look much nicer
- Renamed and reorganized drop-down options to make more sense
- Created submenus for related options
- Improved screenshot quality

Feature-related: (by TacoTheDank)
- Added ability to clear background only
- Added ability to clear both the foreground and the background at the same time
- Disabled share feature, as proper implementation for compileSdk above 23 requires support libraries that will severely bloat the APK
